			Boozhoo, friends and relatives.<br><br>
Yesterday, we did something good. As a Sundance community, we honored our commitments and ceremony by offering our prayers and asking for guidance and giving thanks for what we have. Some of us did this while gathering in small groups and some by respectfully honoring their commitments  by praying alone. Whichever way you chose to do this, miigwech for your offerings and for your commitment to our Sundance ceremony.<br><br> 

As our Sundance season begins, we’re now on call. As human beings, we’ve asked our ancestors and our Creator to pity us and show us the way to that good life. Because we’re pitiful human beings, we know that we want a good life, but we don’t know the best way to achieve it. And so we ask for that guidance and then we wait for it. If we listen with our hearts, pay attention to those messages, and listen to each other, we’ll receive that guidance and understanding that we need. Whatever our background, whatever our teachings, whatever our level of understanding about this way of life, that simple approach has always been at the heart of our collective Eagle Sundance family. If we continue to respect that process, we’ll continue to find our way to that good life.<br><br>

Now, we wait and listen. Miigwech, dancers. Miigwech, helpers. Miigwech, supporters. As we learn more about what and when our Sundance ceremony will be this year, we’ll continue to share that information with our Sundance family. Keep praying and stay safe and respectful. Big love to us all and talk to you again soon...</b><br><br>


		
		4/26/2020<br><br>
		Boozhoo, Eagle Sundance family:<br><br>

At this point, you should start praying about whether or not you NEED to be on the grounds during this year’s Sundance. Really pray for guidance at this time. We all know that you want to be there, but it has to be about NEED this year.<br><br>

Part of the challenge this year is figuring out when Sundance will happen. We pretty much have to be ready to go on very short notice. So that's going to make it difficult for some people because there may be almost no notice when it's time to go to the grounds for Sundance. The Sundance dates depend on so many factors.. as it is, the Canadian border is still closed. A closed border means no Cory. And no Cory means no Sundance. Sundance will happen this year, but there's no way to know what the dates will be at this point. We will do our best to try and give as much notice as possible.<br><br>

When Sundance does happen this season, you'll have the option to honor your commitment at home. This means you'd have to fast at home and we will provide instructions for that soon. For those that NEED to be at the grounds this year, but also don't feel safe being in close proximity to other people, there will also be the option of individually fasting on the grounds but away from other people. And that will also count as honoring your Sundance commitment.<br><br>

At this time, we are fully expecting to have the Sundance lodge built and are committed to having the Sundance ceremony as usual for those that need to honor their commitments that way.<br><br>

It really has to be about NEED this year. Because even though we know you want to be at the Sundance, we have to think about the safety of everyone involved. If there is ANY chance that you may be infected with Covid-19 (if you are showing any signs of being sick) when it is time to gather for the Sundance, PLEASE stay home. Think about your loved ones and community members this year. We want the Sundance to be as safe as possible for everyone.<br><br>

We will also be much more strict about coming and going from the Sundance grounds. We can't have people making any unnecessary trips to town and back from the grounds this year.<br><br>

You will have a few different options for honoring your Sundance commitment and there is no judgement or pressure attached to any of them. Because if there's any chance you may be infected at that time, or you're concerned about becoming infected at the Sundance, we will all love you for sacrificing your ability to be at the grounds with your community and choosing to honor your commitment from home. At the same time, if you know you NEED to be at the grounds for Sundance this year, we love you for coming to Highbridge to Sundance with us. Pray hard for guidance at this time. Remember... we try only to take what we NEED in this life. There's a teaching there. Pray hard about that. Think about your loved ones and Sundance community. Follow your heart.<br><br>

Ultimately, we must be prepared for anything. Depending on what our world looks like as Eagle Sundance gets closer, these plans may change slightly and even drastically. Be safe and take care. Check this page frequently for further updates. If you have any question, please contact us.<br><br>

Miigwech,<br><br>

		Boozhoo, friends and relatives!<br><br>
We will NOT be meeting for the prep meeting on May 16th, however we will honor that prep meeting by having a pipe ceremony at home.<br>
Because our communities are not hosting sweatlodge ceremonies that are open to everyone (due to the seriousness of the Covid-19 coronavirus), on May 16th at noon, Cory, Joe, Angela, and Curtis will be having personal sweatlodge ceremonies at their homes to pray for our Sundance family. For those dancers and helpers that do not have the ability to have a personal sweatlodge ceremony at that time, we are asking you to make a feast plate and offer it to your spirit helpers to ask them for their help in understanding how to proceed with our Sundance ceremony this year in the safest way possible. There will also be a pipe ceremony that evening that we are asking all dancers, helpers, and supporters to participate in. We are asking pipe carriers in our Sundance community to light their pipes at 7pm Central Time so that we can create one huge prayer together at that time. If you don't have a pipe, you can still participate by burning or offering your tobacco at that time and praying for our Sundance, our dancers, and our helpers. We will ask our Creator and ancestors to help us and recognize that we are doing our best to honor our Sundance Prep commitments even though we cannot meet in person at this time. We are praying and asking our Creator and ancestors to help us understand the safest way for us to meet for our Sundance ceremony this year.<br><br>
We are also arranging for a video call soon, for anyone interested, using the Eagle Sundance Phone on this webpage. During that video call we can answer any questions you may have about the upcoming, at-home Sundance Prep meeting scheduled for May 16th. Scheduling details for the video call will be posted here soon. Check this webpage regularly to stay up-to-date on Eagle Sundance information...<br><br>

	Boozhoo,<br><br>
On our Eagle Sundance webpage, you'll find basic scheduling, helpful resources, and contact information. Some of us may start to feel extremely isolated as the weeks go by. We want to encourage everyone to keep in touch with each other. Check in on each other occasionally. Some of you have been doing that already. Miigwech for that thoughtfulness. Maybe we could even arrange for a regularly scheduled, group video chat using the Eagle Sundance Phone on this webpage. It's free and easy to use. If that's something that would be helpful, we can set that up. Let us know.<br><br>


<i>Message from Cory:</i><br>
"Boozhoo and a hearty hello family,<br><br>
Warm greetings to you all. I wanted to send a quick hello and let you all know that I’m thinking of you all. I have taken some of the words of our brother Jeff and added them to my thoughts. Much thanks to him for sharing with me and others.<br><br>
These troubled times we find ourselves in have not been without precedence. Throughout this century and indeed over the past 500 years, from the arctic circle to Patagonia, the First Nations peoples have been subjugated to disease, warfare, starvation, colonization, marginalization, residential/boarding schools, religious indoctrination, relocation, internment, medical experiments, and concerted efforts of physical, cultural, linguistic and spiritual genocide by the most powerful political and military forces in the world …. And yet through it all we endured, we survived, and we have thrived. Even for our relatives who trace their lineage back to Europe, Africa and Asia; examples of similar practices of colonization and warfare exist within history, and examples of pandemic type diseases exist (bubonic plague), yet they too, survived and thrived.<br><br>
Our cultural ways of looking after one another, the reciprocity and interconnectedness, the core teachings of community, selflessness and love at the heart of our ceremonies is the strength our ancestors relied on to face the challenges of their time and I believe is what will help us with the challenges of our own time. This gift that was carried though suffering beyond comprehension passed generation to generation from our ancestors to us is our strength, our hope and our way of communal, cultural and spiritual perseverance.<br><br>
As we approach the new seasons of spring and summer, we look forward to coming together at our “big ceremony” and celebrating the new life Mother Earth is providing for our benefits. Unfortunately, this current situation does not give us surety that we will be able to gather in the same way that we normally would. Despite this, we can still do our parts and do our ceremonies; let us celebrate the stirring of life within the earth with a stirring of prayer and connection to and for each other in our hearts. Offer your tobacco via a fire, a tree, a body of water. Lift up your pipes and smudge bowls in prayer for one another and lift up your phones to check in with your friends, family and neighbors. Even as we limit our physical interactions to protect our collective physical safety, we can reach out to support each other’s well-being. We can offer words of love and friendship to reduce the impact of social isolation. But this has always been the way of our people, the way the old ones always behaved.<br><br>
It is my sincere hope that we are all healthy in all aspects of our medicine wheels. Health authorities tell us that the physical concern that coronavirus causes is not something to be taken lightly. I would also like to ask that we take care of our mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of ourselves. Our ceremonies and medicines have proven to baffle the medical system, often seeing “miracle cures” as a result of our faith and the love Creator holds for us. It is hoped that we can all find the medicines necessary to help us fight off this new disease. Many are smoking their pipes collectively and on our own, praying for health, hope and happiness for our relatives and families. Many are still holding Sweatlodge (indeed in our own communities, but in a more intimate, less crowded way than usual); prayers are plenty.<br><br>
During these times of “social distancing” or “self-isolation” we may find that our feelings of anxiousness as a result of our wintering and for some folks, cabin fever can begin to feel overwhelming. I have been compelled to think of this time as a fast of sorts. Going within myself, I have been able to find much time for prayer. We have for long and long taken time to be with ourselves, sitting with Creator and giving up certain comforts in order to receive gifts from Creator. Vision, direction and guidance are frequently the result of our fasts. I have found doing my social distancing in a prayerful way helpful.<br><br>
Another silver lining for me has been extended time with my immediate family and taking the opportunity to check in deeply with my children and grandchildren. Before long, I realized how limited my time with them can be. A blessing in disguise, I wish the same for all of you who find themselves unable to go to work, unable to go to a restaurant to eat, and unable to attend ceremonies and dances.<br><br>
It is not my intention to cause confusion or share my thoughts as a way of telling anybody what to do. The truth is sometimes I don’t know what to do. My hope is to say hello and let everyone know that I’m thinking of you. Joe and I will do our best to keep you as informed as possible as to what is going to happen for our dance this year. We have already changed the April prep to May 16, but we must prepare for that to change. We may not even be able to gather in June, but we should still prepare for our dance to take place as usual. The bottom line is the dance will happen this summer at some point before the leaves fall. We must prepare ourselves for the dance to be very different than usual. Prayers are being said, guidance is being sought and it is hoped that we can provide answers that are clear and definitive as soon as possible.<br><br>  
Until we can see each other again, my sincere hopes for good health, hope and happiness for you all. Mother Earth is waking up again. The cranes have returned to my neck of the woods, and the spirits of the earth are becoming active.<br><br>
Peace, Love and Oreos everybody.<br><br>
